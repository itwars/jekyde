title: Basic Structure
---

A basic Jekyde site usually looks something like this:

<pre>
|--- source
   |-- layout
      |-- archive.html
      |-- index.html
      |-- page.html
      |-- post.html
   |-- page
      |-- about.md
      |-- guide.md
      |-- latex.md
   |-- post
      |-- 2013-04-04-16-24.md
      |-- 2013-04-05-17-59.md
   |-- static
      |-- image.png
      |-- script.js
      |-- style.css
   |-- config.yaml
|-- website
   |-- archive
   |-- page
   |-- post
   |-- static
   |-- index.html
</pre>

An overview of what each of these does:

## source

This folder contains all your source files.

#### config.yml

This file stores configuration data.

#### layout

These are the templates for generating post, page, index and archive files.

#### post

Your post files written in markdown language. The format of these files should be `year-month-day-hour-minute.md`.

#### page

Your page files written in markdown language. There is no restriction for filename format of these files.

#### static

This folder contains your css, javascript and image files. This folder will be copied to `website` folder without any modification.

## website

This is where the generated site will be placed once Jekyde is done generating it.
