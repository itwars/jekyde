title: Basic Structure
---

A basic Jekyde site usually looks something like this:

<pre>
|-- content
   |-- post
      |-- 2013-04-30-16-24.md
      |-- 2013-05-10-17-59.md
   |-- page
      |-- about.md
      |-- guide.md
      |-- latex.md
   |-- file
      |-- one.jpg
      |-- two.txt
|-- template
   |-- layout
      |-- archive.html
      |-- index.html
      |-- page.html
      |-- post.html
   |-- static
      |-- image.png
      |-- script.js
      |-- style.css
   |-- config.yaml
|-- website
   |-- archive
   |-- file
   |-- page
   |-- post
   |-- static
   |-- index.html
</pre>

An overview of what each of these does:

## content

This folder contains all your content files.

#### content -> post

Your post files written in markdown language. The format of these files should be `year-month-day-hour-minute.md`.

#### content -> page

Your page files written in markdown language. There is no restriction for filename format of these files.

#### content -> file

Other content used in your blog, such as your photos. This folder will be copied to `website` folder without any modification.

## template

This folder contains all your template files.

#### template -> config.yml

This file stores configuration data.

#### template -> layout

These are the templates for generating post, page, index and archive files.

#### template -> static

This folder contains your css, javascript and image files. The folder will be copied to `website` folder without any modification.

## website

This is where the generated site will be placed once Jekyde is done generating it.
